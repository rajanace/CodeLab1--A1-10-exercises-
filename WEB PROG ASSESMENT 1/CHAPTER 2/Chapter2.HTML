    <h1>Money Heist (La Casa de Papel)</h1>

    <!-- Overview section covers the show's storyline and two major heists -->
    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <!-- Introduction sets up The Professor's leadership and the heists' deeper meaning -->
        <p>The story is divided into two major heists: one at the Royal Mint of Spain and another at the Bank of Spain. Each heist is meticulously planned and executed under the leadership of The Professor, who orchestrates everything from behind the scenes. His goal is not just to steal money but also to challenge the system and expose the flaws in the government and financial institutions.</p>
        
        <!-- First heist introduces the core team and their mission at the Royal Mint -->
        <h3>The Royal Mint Heist (Seasons 1 & 2)</h3>
        <p>The series begins with The Professor assembling a team of eight criminals, each given a city name as their alias: Tokyo, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Moscow, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Their mission is to break into the Royal Mint of Spain, print €2.4 billion, and escape without getting caught.</p>
        <p>The team infiltrates the Mint, takes hostages, and begins printing money while keeping the police at bay. As the heist progresses, personal conflicts, betrayals, and love affairs complicate the plan. Tokyo and Rio develop a romantic relationship, Denver falls for a hostage named Monica Gaztambide, who later joins the group as Stockholm, and Berlin, the team's ruthless but charismatic leader inside the Mint, makes significant sacrifices.</p>
        <p>Despite intense police pressure and multiple setbacks, the gang manages to escape with the money, though not without losses. Berlin sacrifices himself to hold off the police, allowing the rest of the team to flee. The Professor also develops a romantic relationship with Raquel Murillo, the lead police investigator, who eventually switches sides and joins him.</p>
        
        <!-- Second heist shows the team reuniting for an even more ambitious mission -->
        <h3>The Bank of Spain Heist (Seasons 3-5)</h3>
        <p>After their successful escape, the gang disperses and tries to live normal lives. However, when Rio is captured by the authorities and tortured, Tokyo persuades The Professor to reunite the team for another heist—this time targeting the Bank of Spain, aiming to steal gold reserves.</p>
        <p>New members join the gang, including Palermo, Bogotá, and Marseille, while The Professor operates from the outside. The heist at the Bank of Spain is even more dangerous than the first, with the police, government, and military escalating their response. The gang faces internal struggles, betrayals, and shocking deaths. Nairobi, a fan-favorite character, is executed by the police, leading to a turning point in the heist.</p>
        <p>The final part of the series revolves around The Professor trying to outsmart the government while dealing with the ruthless Alicia Sierra, a pregnant police inspector who is determined to capture him. However, as the heist nears its climax, alliances shift. Alicia eventually joins The Professor and helps him in the final stages of the plan.</p>
        <p>In the end, the gang successfully extracts the gold, fakes their deaths, and manages to escape with new identities, proving that their heist was not just about money—it was a revolution against the system.</p>
